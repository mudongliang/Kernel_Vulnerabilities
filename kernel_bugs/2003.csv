CVE-2003-0001,CWE-200
CVE-2003-0018,"Linux kernel 2.4.10 through 2.4.21-pre4 does not properly handle the O_DIRECT feature, which allows local attackers with write privileges to read portions of previously deleted files, or cause file system corruption.$"
CVE-2003-0127,"The kernel module loader in Linux kernel 2.2.x before 2.2.25, and 2.4.x before 2.4.21, allows local users to gain root privileges by using ptrace to attach to a child process that is spawned by the kernel.$"
CVE-2003-0187,"The connection tracking core of Netfilter for Linux 2.4.20, with CONFIG_IP_NF_CONNTRACK enabled or the ip_conntrack module loaded, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource consumption) due to an inconsistency with Linux 2.4.20's support of linked lists, which causes Netfilter to fail to identify connections with an UNCONFIRMED status and use large timeouts.$"
CVE-2003-0244,"The route cache implementation in Linux 2.4, and the Netfilter IP conntrack module, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via packets with forged source addresses that cause a large number of hash table collisions.$"
CVE-2003-0246,"The ioperm system call in Linux kernel 2.4.20 and earlier does not properly restrict privileges, which allows local users to gain read or write access to certain I/O ports.$"
CVE-2003-0418,"The Linux 2.0 kernel IP stack does not properly calculate the size of an ICMP citation, which causes it to include portions of unauthorized memory in ICMP error responses.$"
CVE-2003-0462,A race condition in the way env_start and env_end pointers are initialized in the execve system call and used in fs/proc/base.c on Linux 2.4 allows local users to cause a denial of service (crash).$
CVE-2003-0465,"The kernel strncpy function in Linux 2.4 and 2.5 does not %NUL pad the buffer on architectures other than x86, as opposed to the expected behavior of strncpy as implemented in libc, which could lead to information leaks.$"
CVE-2003-0467,"Unknown vulnerability in ip_nat_sack_adjust of Netfilter in Linux kernels 2.4.20, and some 2.5.x, when CONFIG_IP_NF_NAT_FTP or CONFIG_IP_NF_NAT_IRC is enabled, or the ip_nat_ftp or ip_nat_irc modules are loaded, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) in systems using NAT, possibly due to an integer signedness error.$"
CVE-2003-0476,"The execve system call in Linux 2.4.x records the file descriptor of the executable process in the file table of the calling process, which allows local users to gain read access to restricted file descriptors.$"
CVE-2003-0501,"The /proc filesystem in Linux allows local users to obtain sensitive information by opening various entries in /proc/self before executing a setuid program, which causes the program to fail to change the ownership and permissions of those entries.$"
CVE-2003-0619,Integer signedness error in the decode_fh function of nfs3xdr.c in Linux kernel before 2.4.21 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (kernel panic) via a negative size value within XDR data of an NFSv3 procedure call.$
CVE-2003-0643,Integer signedness error in the Linux Socket Filter implementation (filter.c) in Linux 2.4.3-pre3 to 2.4.22-pre10 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (crash).$
CVE-2003-0956,"Multiple race conditions in the handling of O_DIRECT in Linux kernel prior to version 2.4.22 could cause stale data to be returned from the disk when handling sparse files, or cause incorrect data to be returned when a file is truncated as it is being read, which might allow local users to obtain sensitive data that was originally owned by other users, a different vulnerability than CVE-2003-0018.$This vulnerability affects Linux O_DIRECT versions 2.4.22 and previous$"
CVE-2003-0961,Integer overflow in the do_brk function for the brk system call in Linux kernel 2.4.22 and earlier allows local users to gain root privileges.$
CVE-2003-0984,"Real time clock (RTC) routines in Linux kernel 2.4.23 and earlier do not properly initialize their structures, which could leak kernel data to user space.$"
CVE-2003-0985,"The mremap system call (do_mremap) in Linux kernel 2.4.x before 2.4.21, and possibly other versions before 2.4.24, does not properly perform bounds checks, which allows local users to cause a denial of service and possibly gain privileges by causing a remapping of a virtual memory area (VMA) to create a zero length VMA, a different vulnerability than CAN-2004-0077.$"
CVE-2003-0986,"Various routines for the ppc64 architecture on Linux kernel 2.6 prior to 2.6.2 and 2.4 prior to 2.4.24 do not use the copy_from_user function when copying data from userspace to kernelspace, which crosses security boundaries and allows local users to cause a denial of service.$"
CVE-2003-1040,"kmod in the Linux kernel does not set its uid, suid, gid, or sgid to 0, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (crash) by sending certain signals to kmod.$"
CVE-2003-1161,"exit.c in Linux kernel 2.6-test9-CVS, as stored on kernel.bkbits.net, was modified to contain a backdoor, which could allow local users to elevate their privileges by passing __WCLONE|__WALL to the sys_wait4 function.$"
